Here's the question everyone's been asking.

Did you really think you could win? Did you really think you have what it takes to defeat me? I know that in the last millenia or so there's been several people who have tried but not since then they've given up, they knew it was a joke.

They had no chance and neither do you, you're like an ice cream cone on the top of the leaning tower of pisa, dripping all the way to the floor like a lost chalkboard in the dump. Hah!
